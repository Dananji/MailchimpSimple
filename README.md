# MailchimpSimple
A library to handle mailing lists in Mailchimp (http://mailchimp.com/)

# Introduction
This library is written in Haskell, to interact with Mailchimp's JSON API. The initial commit supports only the Mailchimp 2.0 version.
This currently implements couple of methods in the 'lists' section, they are;
	Adding subscribers
	List out the subscribers in a mailing list
	List the mailing lists for given 'apikey'
	Past activities performed on a mailing list

I hope to develop this further to support Mailchimp version 3.0 as well.
